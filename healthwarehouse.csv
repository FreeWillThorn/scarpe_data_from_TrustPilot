1,Surprising quick delivery at this time…,Surprising quick delivery at this time of year. Order fulfilled quickly with no issues. Definitely a top tier vendor.,5,2024-12-09,Stephen Tate,US
2,Best online pharmacy going,"Been with this pharmacy for around 3 years now and they have been outstanding and totally legit. The one and only time my prescription was late had nothing to do with them, It just got lost in the mail for about a week but they worked with my doctor so I didnt have to go without my medication. That sucks but its not their fault, they don't control the courier service.

I don't know how there is even one bad review on this place saying there are better out there because I couldn't find one. Not even Amazon has their prices and their medications are just the same quality as your local pharmacy and their prices are the best I have found. Total props for friendliness customer service, pharmacist, and the whole team works So well and very efficiently.",5,2024-12-10,Mark Crazynosky,US
3,Superb service!,The Health warehouse handled my order superbly. They alerted me when the prescription was expired. Contacted my provider that a new script was needed and still got me my medication on time.,5,2024-11-26,Sally Russell,US
4,Don’t use this service,"Don’t use this service. There are many others out there that do better. They can’t seem to keep their records straight, and maintain prescription refill counts. My doctor’s office has to keep sending in scripts when I order. They won’t accept HSA credit cards to directly pay for my scripts from my HSA. They botched their data systems upgrade and it is still clunky, meaning they aren’t willing to pay to do it right. It has been quite difficult working with them.",1,2024-09-30,Unhappy Customer,US

12,Happy Here!,"I’ve been using Healthwarehouse.com for several years and have never been disappointed. I don’t have a prescription plan, and HW has very good pricing on most of my prescription meds.
They are fast to ship and with no shipping fee. Their Auto-Ship works as expected, and they never miss a beat.
They are efficient whether it be in transferring prescriptions from another pharmacy like CVS or requesting refills from my physicians. I also like that my doctors can transmit prescriptions electronically.
I’m very happy here as a long time customer!",5,2024-10-17,Derek K,US

16,Great Curtious Service,"Health Warehouse has always served me extremely well. The staff is friendly and considerate.

17,First time trying Health Warehouse.,I wasn’t sure how to start my first order and customer service was great. I also got a call from HealthWarehouse because there was a concern with a possible drug interaction so that was really important to me. I will continue to use them.,5,2024-10-09,Ann,US

24,Great service,I like the fact that I get a email saying I need to order or what is on auto order. The people in chat are very helpful and when they say they are going to do something they do it. I get my medicine on time and they are very accurate. Going into your site I fine it hard to know if my order went thru. Also the area where they have new refill doc call in etc that gets confusing no matter how many times I do it.

39,Convenient and less costly than local pharmacy,"Your site makes ordering and receiving meds by mail simple, and at a better price than most other places. I do believe your website needs some changes. It's difficult to understand sometimes, and it keeps telling me I need to send in a prescription even though I have a current one on file with refills available.
