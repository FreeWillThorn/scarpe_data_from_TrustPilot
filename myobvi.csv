1,Well I live in Australia and I received‚Ä¶,"Well I live in Australia and I received my first 3 bottles of Obvi burn Elite yesterday. It only took under 2 weeks to be delivered, so I'm happy about that. I will start this 3 month journey today and give you a full update in 3 months üôèüèº praying I don't have to change my review to something negative.",5,2024-12-14,Kaydence Langton,AU
2,3 weeks waiting,"It's been 3 weeks, and I honestly don't see much of a difference yet. The taste is okay, but I expected better results by now. Maybe it just takes longer, but I'm a bit disappointed so far",2,2024-12-06,chloe,GB
3,Customer service,As I‚Äôve only just started these I can‚Äôt say whether they work for weight loss but I do have more energy and feel better. When my order arrived it was the wrong items. I contacted customer support via email to which they responded within a few days with an apology and promise to ship the correct items. I‚Äôm in New Zealand but sure enough a month later the correct order arrived.,5,2024-10-11,Nicola Turbitt,NZ
4,Australia customer,"Australia customer- I paid for the product on the 5th of November, product has still not been shipped, I sent an email -got an automated ai message, no human interaction. My mum also got some, she spent over $250, she has been given two different consignment numbers neither of the numbers work.",1,2024-11-28,customer,AU
5,INTERNATIONAL BUYERS BEWARE:,"INTERNATIONAL BUYERS BEWARE:
Post-purchase, the company states that it is perfectly normal for shipping to take up to and exceed 4 weeks. In my case shipping took one month and the product still never arrived. The couriers they choose to use appear unreliable as tracking for my shipment simply disappeared in transit after one month. I therefore attempted to cancel my order. The company did offer to resend it, however as it is no longer needed, I declined and requested a refund. The company states that this is not a possibility. 30+ days onwards and it is still unclear as to whether I will ever receive a product. As I said, international buyers BEWARE.",1,2024-11-28,Megan Grant,AU
6,Obvi elite is the bomb!,"Shipping to Aus takes up to 1 month. But the burn elite is worth it. I've ordered my second bottle. The energy they give me is beyond amazing, and without a doubt kills the appetite.
If you want real reviews and stories you must join the Obvi community on Facebook! You will not be disappointed. The only downside to this company is that it's near impossible to get a reply.",5,2024-09-19,Shannon,AU
7,Refunds,"Hi I think Canadians should be eligible for refunds.I ordered and when I seen price with exchange I can't afford that on a monthly basis.When I called they said no refund to Canadians, I didn't see that posted anywhere.That should be advertised. Looking tho that ppl said it didn't work for them",1,2024-10-31,Gayle Watson,CA
8,This company is a SCAM,"This company is a SCAM! Do not purchase from them. They do NOT stand by there money back guarantee. I requested a refund and to return the remaining product. They never returned my call, I called again and left another voicemail and they finally called back and said they would send me a return link in an email. They NEVER did and then when I reached out again they said to log in to my account and try it there, well to my surprise when l tried to log in to my account it said ""NO ACCOUNT FOUND"" so I reached back out via email and they said to create a new account well it wouldnt let me do that, i don't have an order number. So I asked how can I retrieve that information if I can't access my account. They told me to try the link again so I did after a week of fighting with them and when I tried to do a refund/return it said window closed for return. So now I'm stuck with a product that DOES NOT work and want to warn others before trusting this company.",1,2024-11-01,Ember Senko,US

10,I am a stage 4 cancer survivor,I am a stage 4 cancer survivor (in remission since February 2020) but chemo did so much damage to my body that I now have MDS. My energy level has been so bad but I have taken these supplements for about 3 days now and my energy level has come up quite abit. I fell so much better and I believe this is what your product has done for me!!!,5,2022-01-07,Melba Neal,US
11,I absolutely love all of the obvi‚Ä¶,"I absolutely love all of the obvi products that I have tried. Collagenic burn, detox, super collagen protein powders. The protein powders are the best tasting out of all the different ones I have tried. Dissolve well and no chalky texture. Flavor is spot on. My husband even likes them in his coffee now.",5,2022-01-05,Denise Buck,US
12,"New widow and BURN, a beautiful combination.","I have been very impressed with Onvi. Being a widow had drawn some of the vigor and vitality out of my normal self. I have started eating healthier, despite the fact that I‚Äôm a good Southern cook and added exercise to my life. Just signed up for line dancing at 68 years young. Now imagine that sight. I‚Äôm taking BURN and after one week I have more energy in one day than I did the last year combined.",5,2022-01-05,Kathy Riggan,US
13,Great for hair and nails,"I‚Äôve been using Obvi collagen for five months, and I can tell a huge difference in my hair, nails, and skin. My hair is longer, fuller and healthier than it ever has been. I stopped getting acrylics put on my nails, because my natural nails are so long and strong.",5,2023-01-10,Sonya C,US
14,Very unprofessional,Obvi needs to do better for their customers international. It's been 5 weeks since I've purchased now and they don't refund for lost or damage items despite waiting over a month. All they said is they will reship but that's not good enough to say I payed $60+ for delivery. Tracking stopped 3 weeks ago aswell.,1,2024-09-27,Annie,AU
15,Feeling like this is a scam,"Feeling like this is a scam. Placed an order over a month ago, tracking hasn't updated since the 8th September. Contacted customer service twice, they only replied once to say it doesn't count as ""lost"" yet and aren't responding to my enquiries since. Calling my bank to report it as a scam now and hopefully get my funds back.",1,2024-09-26,GW,AU
16,This ACTUALLY does what they say!!!,"I started using Obvi after I had Bariatric surgery and my hair got so thin and was hardly growing at all! Saw a FB video of person I follow that had same issues when she tried it and said it made huge dfrce. I gave it a shot and goin on 2 yrs later, I am an avid customer/supporter! I saw huge dfrnce within the 1st few weeks! My hair started growing again, thickening up again and looking overall healthier! Absolutely LOVE LOVE Obvi! I currently use 3 of their products (Burn, Guilt & Gummies) that not only help me maintain vitamins I need reg after having surgery but also continue to keep my hair, nails and energy, up! I even have my mom and several friends using it as well!! Thus truly is a product that does what it says!",5,2022-01-03,Chantay Swoopes Ratliff,US
17,A little scoop of heaven,"So, I first bought the birthday cupcake collagen because I am a sucker for anything birthday cake flavored. But, I kept reading all the reviews for the peppermint mocha collagen and how fantastic it was and that it was only available for a limited time and...I bought a peppermint mocha collagen before I even tasted the birthday cupcake! In my coffee every morning I put that little scoop of heaven and think fondly of Obvi! No lie, the peppermint mocha is awesome. I have already shared my peppermint mocha with my mother and purchased another. While waiting for my replacement peppermint mocha I finally tried the birthday cupcake and I will say it was also amazing. So much yummy!",5,2022-01-05,Heather Dickerson,US
18,A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY,"If I could give them less than one I would. Money back guarantee is bogus. That is awful and very misleading about the money back guarantee. To suggest that the product needs to used for a few month to see results, suggest to make purchase on that basis, say you offer a 30 day money back guarantee and put specific requirements in your FAQs is deceitful to say the least. So I made the purchase with that thought in mine and the reason I purchased the volume. I wouldn't have purchased so much if Id known there were specific requirements of the return. Now I'm stuck with 4 bottles of stuff I can't use and causes cramping üò´. They will only accept 2 of the 6 bottles purchased, I would have to pay to return the 2 bottle minus a 20% restocking fee..",5,2023-06-13,Kasey C. Wood,US

25,Don't fall for this scam,"Don't fall for this. It's a big scam. I never received my order and the tracking stopped 3 weeks ago, well past estimated delivery date. They never responded to any emails. I filed case through PayPal and just received a notification that they closed the case. When I checked why, it turns out the seller provided a fake tracking showing it was delivered! Reopening the case as we speak and providing the real tracking for my item.

31,False advertising,"False advertising. They say you will get a refund within 90 days but when you contact them and say you‚Äôre not happy.. this is their response. Buy it but know if they are lying about a refund, what else are they lying about‚Ä¶?

Hi Naomi,

I'm sorry but that is for domestic orders only. Also, we don't advertises a full refund. There is a 20% restocking fee.

33,Obvi is the Best! Just try it!,I continue to use Obvi because of the way it makes me feel. I am about 6 or so months in and could not be more of a fan. I consistently use Hello to get me going in the morning. Nice energy boost to begin my day. Collagenic Burn a Breakfast and Lunch curbs my appetite just enough to make sure I am not eating too much. Goodbye has replaced the nightly melatonin I used to take for years. If you have not tried Obvi.....do it! You'll love it.,5,2022-01-11,Chrissy Champion,US
34,"Snake Oil, Now in Convenient Capsule Form!","Wow, where do I start? This product is so useless, it should come with a free T-shirt that says, ""I bought snake oil, and all I got was this lousy charge in American dollars."" That's right, they advertise in Australia but kindly slap you with USD when it‚Äôs time to pay‚Äîsneaky, huh?

I raised the issue, but they waited three days to reply, by which time my magical order had already shipped. How convenient! They market this stuff like it‚Äôs the next best thing to injectable weight loss meds. Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôve had better results from eating salad... and I hate salad.

I reached out to these guys when they tried making a payment to my old PayPal account, however I was informed they couldn't find my account (strange since they tried to pay me and I had received payments in the past....)

They then proceeded to tell me that they had moved affiliate programs and the old one was no longer valid to use. There was 0 indication that we needed to sign up to a new program. No worries, I thought, just transfer my outstanding balance to the new program.

I then sent them 4 emails with the above query and was met with a negative response about how they would not honor the outstanding balance. I was then told in that same email:

""In order to receive the payout for $900, please show us your social media platforms and where you are promoting your code.""

We never promoted a ""code"". Their affiliate program had links that you would use and that's where all of our sales had come from (over $10,000 in sales within 30 days). This shows they didn't even know how their own store works.

143,Artificial sweeteners = BITTER AFTERTASTE,"Based on the absolutely glowing reviews, I decided to try a couple of flavors. I bought fruity cereal and chocolate cereal. I do drink things like Orgain and Premier Protein, so I thought (again, based on the insanely positive reviews) that these would be similar.
Both flavors were downright HORRIBLE. Sickly sweet at first, quickly followed by an intensely bitter aftertaste that is not washed away, even by drinking copious amounts of water. I had to brush my teeth to keep from clawing at my tongue to get rid of that nasty, lingering bitterness. I had a friend try the fruity cereal and she complained of the same problem. It didn't matter if these were mixed with cold water, unsweetened or sweetened almond milk. The problem is the fake sugar used. If you're used to eating a lot of artificial sweetener, this will be right up your alley. But if you're used to natural sweeteners, this will be intensely bitter.

They claim a money back guarantee, but it certainly isn't easy to find on the website. Once I figured it out, I saw they charge customers for return shipping AND a 20% restocking fee. Let me ask you, do you think an opened product will be restocked? Yeah, gross.
I chucked them in the trash and just considered this an expensive lesson. I have warned others to steer clear of this stuff. Not only is it gross, but all that artificial garbage can't be good for a person.",1,2022-07-11,Mary Kaufman,US

That‚Äôs 6 items according to them. I have tried all of these products and they don‚Äôt work. I contacted them to send back all of this stuff and get my money back bc this is false advertisement. Apparently they only allow you to send back TWO items due to fraud. The only fraud is this company though. If they allowed people to send back the items because they don‚Äôt work they wouldn‚Äôt make any profit. So according to them they limit you to 2 returns. If you‚Äôre really considering this product or company, I HIGHLY suggest getting them to email you something stating you can return ALL the items for a FULL refund if it doesn‚Äôt work.

Very RUDE SCAMMED I ordered one item and glad that's all I ordered of course it came with a calif prop 65 meaning I could be exposed to lead! I tried the burn caps for 2 days and nothing so I wanted to return under there 30 day money back mind you they charge a 20 % restock fee which is silly I sure hope they do not plan to restock an open product or sell it to someone else. Well I reached out to them via email- no response then reached out to them on there chat on facebook - no response other then they m blocking me from commenting or contacting them! Let me say that is not customer service period! They obviously do not stand behind these product's at all. Seems like they take your money esp if you don't like the products. Advertising a 30 money back and not abiding by it is fraud and blocking people from reaching out to resolve an issue it tells me they are scamming people out of there hard earned money. Who know how many other are out there in the same boat since the block and remove anything negative about the products or customer service. Instead of helping fix the issue and abiding by their 30 day money back Just beware so happy I did not spend $ 200 like I was planning to do I would be out more money. Right now I'm out $39.99 the products are filled with artificial colors and flavors and the burn caps have titanium dioxide that's not good look it up I don't think I will get my money back at all so beware before you buy!

So I ordered these capsules 60 of them for $40.00. Within 5 minutes after I ordered them I canceled it. Because I found out that I could get the same thing at walmart but double the capsules 120 for $20.00 that's $10.00 less than the on line company sells them for. So I sent an email to the online company. Told them I wanted to cancel the order. I was sent 3 days later an email saying that the order was already placed and they would not be able to cancel the order. But they could credit me $5.00. That did not happen.

176,Not an honest company,"I had placed an order in February of 22 and it was an absolute mess. I waited 2 weeks for my order it never arrived so I checked and it hadn‚Äôt even shipped. I reached out to them and several of the items I had ordered were out of stock and they weren‚Äôt sure why I was able to purchase them because they hadn‚Äôt been in stock for a while. So they canceled those items and shipped my order. I decided I would wait a while until I made a purchase again and gave other brands a try. In July of 22 I made another purchase a rather large one. And though I got everything on my order it took well over 2 weeks for it to ship. At that point I decided I wasn‚Äôt going to purchase from Obvi for a while until they could figure out their order fulfillment process. Because clearly it was a hot mess and only getting worse. Fast forward a year later and I see several people raving on social media about how their shipping is quick and products are amazing (which they have always had great product) so I decided I would give them one more chance. And lo and behold the same crap show once more. I placed my order after 2 weeks of no product, and the fact that I paid for VIP processing so it would ship in less than 2 days. I went to my order to get the tracking number cause I figured oh it‚Äôs problem just USPS being slow. Nope my order still hadn‚Äôt shipped, here we go again. So I reached out and the next morning I got an email back. But it was the same song and some of the products I ordered were out of stock there for they couldn‚Äôt fill my order. Why as a consumer do I need to track this company down and make them do their job??? As a small business owner myself, it‚Äôs not hard to reach out to your customer and let them know that some of the items they ordered were out of stock and issue a refund. The customer shouldn‚Äôt have to ask for their money back. But that wasn‚Äôt even the worst of it, multiple emails and 2 refund initiations to get my money owned back. Then I get told that the reward credit that I had used would NOT be returned to me because once it‚Äôs used it‚Äôs gone. If it was only a couple dollars ok, but we‚Äôre talking almost $70 in credit here. That was the final straw for me. I will not support a business that is dishonest. But I will make sure I share my experience everywhere, and yes I have the receipts to back it up as well.",1,2023-07-26,Diana,US

179,Awful Experience,"My experience with Obvi's detox product has been nothing short of a nightmare, leaving both myself and my clients feeling ill and regretful. To make matters worse, the company's limited return policy, despite boasting a 30-day money-back guarantee, and their restocking fee have only added insult to injury.

First and foremost, the detox product from Obvi failed to deliver the promised results. Instead of feeling revitalized and rejuvenated, both I and my clients experienced adverse effects, including nausea, digestive discomfort, and fatigue. This is highly concerning, as a health-oriented product should prioritize the well-being of its users rather than causing harm.

When attempting to return the unsatisfactory product, Obvi's restrictive return policy came into play. Despite their apparent 30-day money-back guarantee, they placed an arbitrary limit of just two items for returns. This limitation is unreasonable and fails to provide the necessary flexibility for customers who may have purchased multiple items in good faith. It's a clear contradiction to their own advertised guarantee, leaving customers frustrated and dissatisfied.

Adding insult to injury, Obvi imposes a restocking fee on returns. Charging customers for returning a product that made them feel ill is not only unjustifiable but also shows a lack of empathy and concern for their customers' well-being. A restocking fee should only be applied in cases where the returned items are damaged or significantly devalued, not as a means to discourage customers from seeking a refund for a faulty product.

In conclusion, Obvi's detox product has not only failed to live up to its claims but has also caused discomfort and illness among its users. The company's limited return policy and restocking fee further exacerbate the issue, leaving dissatisfied customers with little recourse. I strongly advise potential customers to reconsider purchasing from Obvi, as their approach to customer satisfaction and product quality is sorely lacking.",1,2023-07-12,Carlos Paulo,US

I responded that I would like a refund of the second container. I will be anxious to see the reply. This was my first time ordering and my last.
