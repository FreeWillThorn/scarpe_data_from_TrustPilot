1,Where are you PureKana????,"For months I've received emails about my loyalty points and to use them before they expire. And only today did I discover they are no longer in business? I used their website contact form many times but never received a response. I suppose they are ""history."" They could at least respond to loyal customer's emails and honor the points accrued by those customers. But such is the world of business, I suppose.
I really liked their products.",2,2024-09-02,Lisa,US

8,Review update: Purchased this product without results,"Purchased this product without results. Returned the product before the 30 days with verified tracking number. Still waiting for the refund.

11,They don't let customers know that…,"They don't let customers know that they're out of your item. We had actually fixed it via email (because I contacted them!) by the time they apologized. They're not talking to each other much, nor were they talking to me. Now I have to keep checking on my orders from them. If their product wasn't excellent, I wouldn't tolerate this.",3,2023-11-14,Elizabeth Zollner,US
12,Love the gummies but the lid has to go,"Love the gummies but the lid on the bottle is impossible to get off. This time I had to use pliers and transfer them to a different bottle to avoid further frustration and profanity.

After reading your reply, you must understand that not all of your lids work. There are some that will not move even after pushing harder and turning. I will have to decide if we want to continue with these. You should offer an alternative to those who do not have children in the home.",3,2023-11-09,Jacquie Galvin,US

14,I received another shipment without my…,"I received another shipment without my request. I have tried to contact PUREKANA multiple times. When I call the phone number attached to the credit card bill it immediately disconnects. When attempting to call other numbers found on the internet, all the calls immediately disconnect then too. There have been ZERO responses to any emails sent to their published email address. I would like a full refund since I now have more than I need.",1,2024-03-13,GR Caspian,US
15,Great while you have them and not so good if you run out!!,"I've been using Purekana for a while now and It's always been great for my blood pressure and my little aches and pains went away. The only problem I have is when my reorder doesn't arrive and I run out and my BP and aches start coming back.

18,Paid order was not received.,"My order was placed Mar 18, 2024. I never received it. On March 26 I contacted customer service ""McKayla"" who replied they were behind getting the orders out due to the big response to their sale. On Apr 6 I sent another email to McKayla stating I was still waiting for my shipment. NO response.

Yesterday I received another order which every phone number I call even on my bank statement disconnects or the number is unavailable.

21,The jar you are putting them in now is too tough to get off.,"Well, I love PureKana, however when it takes over an hour to get the lid off it kind of makes you mad. Used pliers, wrenches and knives, and finally a screwdriver that popped the top part of. After having all the gummies fly all over the floor, I put them back in the bottle, so that I could screw the rest of it off.",5,2023-12-31,Suzanne Easterling,US

Never received a refund or any further communication from the company, and they will no longer respond to my inquiries. Tracking shows that they received my return over 6 weeks ago.
If you look them up on BBB, you will find that they have received an ""F"" rating, with multiple complaints filed.",1,2024-03-25,Ben,US

31,Charge and don’t ship product,"Charge and don’t ship product. When you ask for a ETA you’re given a discount code for a future product order not an answer. Very frustrating experience.

Update: After a public reply to address the issue, nothing. I was offered another couple of discount codes for future orders when I can't even get the current order. Disappointed I'll have an empty box under the Christmas tree.",1,2023-12-07,OT,US
32,Deceptive Business Practice,"I was interested and I proceeded to try Your Buy this and we will enhance BOGO . THE SECOND that You Captured my Credit Card info, immediately completed the transaction before I buy. It was utter Bulls××t. To get a refund, prepare for your account BS. Stay away from this business!! One Month plus until my CC was reimbursed. The telephone reps just try to get me to buy. Kiss my Ischial Tuberosity",1,2023-12-09,Robert V Lopp,US
33,Top won’t open.,First and foremost you can not get through to customer service if you place an order on the regular website. You can only call to speak to a customer service person if you put order through Instagram. I had placed a big order from Black Friday. Half of my items I still have not received. My main problem was not being able to open the bottle of gummies. I finally emailed and they did send me a new bottle but when we received the new bottle we could not open that one either. My husband had to cut off the bottom of the jar to get them out. I have three stars because they did send me a new jar. But that top was faulty too.,3,2023-11-28,Nancy,US
34,"Hello, is anybody out there?",I was pleased with the CBD gummies so I signed up for a subscription order. We received gummies for two months and then.....nothing.

36,50 complaints on BBB,"There are almost 50 complaints against PureKana on Better Business Bureau. Most of them are for fraudulent, unapproved charges. Unfortunately I'm switching to a new brand of CBD products after using PureKana for many years. You can't reach anyone by phone if you order directly from their website and are forced to email instead. The loyalty program seems to be intentionally deceptive in several ways. I emailed for months with customer service about missing rewards after following a link to leave a review for reward points. I finally just gave up. There is also no information stating if you cash in reward points that you can't use them with a discount code. Once cashed in, there is no way to use them that makes sense financially (because you lose the discount) and you can't undo the decision.",2,2024-02-09,Jessica Starr,US
37,Ordered 1000 mg gummies on a recurring…,Ordered 1000 mg gummies on a recurring order( twice a month) received 25 mg every time .the first time I thought it was just a mistake..but after 2 months I realized it was intentional..so justed cancelled all further orders..would not recommend this company..very disappointed.. I saved all the empty bottles for proof .,1,2023-12-07,Dara Roop,US
38,I love the product but customer service…,I love the product but customer service is an F. Their packaging was impossible to open (had 4 people try to open and apparently they've had other complaints). They refused to reimburse me without sending it back but when I tried to send back the shipping was over $10. Really disappointing because I've been a loyal fan of their CBD gummies for years but found it unfortunate they couldn't offer any more help (such as free shipping).,2,2023-11-20,Elizabeth Tzagournis,US
39,I’m getting extremely annoyed with this…,"I’m getting extremely annoyed with this company. Lately they are always out of the CBD oil strength that I need. And they never get that strength back in stock, or it takes forever. I use this for anxiety and seizures. It is paramount I have the right strength. I’m looking for a new company. The product itself is good, but this is becoming too much of a regular problem.",3,2023-12-28,Lori Baumgartner,US
40,PureKana now incorporates Kratom in their CBD formulas. I will no longer buy from PureKana,"I have recently noticed that PureKana now offers Kratom. This is not good, as I feel that they incorporate this into their various CBD formulas, of which I personally had experienced adverse reactions. For this reason, I will no longer buy any products from PureKana.",2,2023-11-27,RayDon,US

42,PureKana scams the elder population,I am trying to get a refund from the second package sent to my mother of CBD products. She thought she was buying one package of CBD for $35 and was sent and charged for over $250 and put on a subscription. She kept the first package as she felt maybe she had made the mistake but we now see many have fallen pray to this business tactic of PureKana. She canceled the subscription but was still sent another package. We sent that back and have never received a refund or a response. We have tried reaching out to the Better Business Bureau as well as this company. I see on this page that PureKana intentionally misused this review site as well! So the deception was no accident. The worst part is that my mother could benefit from CBD and has now refused to try it after being scammed by this company. The loss of the money is one thing but the violation of trust for the vulnerable is really unfortunate. The company should be held responsible.,1,2023-12-12,Denisepk,US

47,Bogus Company Beware,"No results. Made a one time purchase but my card was charged again, The reference number on the card was only a recording to sell additional products. After locating the website and a new number I was told it was too late to cancel but they could add to the order. The only immediate action they agreed to was a 35% refund that I may have in 5-7 days. BOGUS COMPANY",1,2024-03-04,Joe Spann,US
48,"Don't receive orders, no response from customer service, seems like company is out of business but still taking orders...","I have been purchasing Pure Kana products for many years now and I honestly loved their products. However, over the last couple years I do not receive my subscriptions on time, or at all most months! They do not respond to email requests for help and there is no way to cancel a subscription online, only pause it. I have tried to reach out to Pure Kana (at 3 different email addresses) to no avail. I feel like the company is out of business and the ""revamping"" of the website is just a stall tactic to keep customers waiting. They have gone downhill in customer service and are no longer able to supply orders to their customers. Honestly, I will never order from them again. There are too many other reputable and high quality companies out there nowadays that sell CBD that have excellent customer service and top notch products. I would not recommend ordering from Pure Kana as you will more than likely not receive your products. :(",1,2024-05-17,AR,US

51,purekana sent me the wrong product,"purekana sent me the wrong product, refuses to send me the right stuff, I've asked for a container to send back the wrong order they sent me, and they refuse to help me. I've told them because they've chosen to be so uncooperative that I will never order from them again, and they simply do not care if they lose a long time customer or not..their mistake, not mine, they are causing me grief because I can't get the stuff I need.

I immediately tried to call to cancel my order but there is no answer after hours so I emailed asked to cancel the order and not charge. I am hoping they honor my request to cancel.

Not only that, trying to reach customer service is a useless exercise in futility: (their call volume is too high, suggesting they have too many complaints and not enough people to handle them). The product itself is fine; too bad customer service is so lacking. Will shop and pursue other companies; my experience to date with PureKana is significantly inferior to others. I’ve been charged almost $150. I’m empty-handed. And cannot reach anyone there to address my complaints. This is disreputable scamming behavior.",1,2024-02-02,Gary Hanrahan,US

I received an email from Pure Kana after my review below was sent and received an email to send them info on order number etc. to rectify. However they NEVER have responded.
I received 15 weeks worth of Pure Kana CBD to improve my chronic cough. After completing my first bottle (only 3 weeks) I called customer service and I can look up call on my phone bill if needed, I was told I needed to take it for longer to get results.
So I took all 15 weeks worth without improvement. I was told today that the money back guarantee is only if returned in the first 30 days and I am not entitled to any refund at all.

I emailed a second time when it was clear the items I ordered for gifts would not arrive in time for Christmas, and they offered to ship the part of my order that they do have in stock, but they haven't done that either. Their last communication on 12/26 said they currently have no ETA, but gave me a 40% off code.

First the ad tells you to pick a door to get a discount, which I did, which was 70%. Then it states that I qualify for free shipping. Then it shows the packages you can choose. I chose one that was buy 3, get 2 free for 39.99. After declining 5 other miscellaneous offers for things I didn't want, it processes the payment and so I scroll down to find out I was charged $247.33.

I called immediately to cancel the order and the young man (Ariel) told me the bottles are $89 each.

86,I placed an order with PureKana and all…,"I placed an order with PureKana and all the further correspondence was from a different company, Vigorvita. When I got the product it was totally different. I screenshot my order, PICTURE OF THE PRODUCT ORDERED and confirmation. I called the company and they said they had no order, yet my credit card was charged. I then looked at my cc and a 3rd company name showed, R4Leif1. PureKana was not concerned their order was highjacked. I suggested they have a supervisor look into it, I got no call. So I returned all the product unopened and now I have been fighting with Vigorvita to get my refund. After months I got a partial refund, they kept $50 for a restocking fee, despite both PureKana and Vigorvita say refunds are no problem, no questions asked. No mention of a restocking fee on the website or in the 5 previous emails sent to me. If I had not screen shotted my order and confirmation I would assume I somehow got on a different website...but I have all the proof.

Was then contacted by the second CC company about two transactions - the one for $52 and a second one for $211, neither of which I completed!

This deal save you about $60 since the original price per bottle is $89.99.With the deal, you get the bottle at a discounted price of $59.99. With that being said, the discounted bundle is the same as getting 1bottle at full price but instead, you get 2!

Normal cost $89.99x2 bottles= $179.98 plus taxes/shipping.

I called to stop this and return the packages and a refund. They refused to let me return the packages and give me a refund and even tried to get me to increase the quantity and shipments!!! But they did finally stop the orders after a few more irate calls from me. The very worst of it all is that I will never be able to use the huge supply I have because just 1 gummie soon caused an altered mental state where my brain didn't function normally. It felt hyperactive, but not at all focused or connected to my environment. My mouth became extremely dry, my vision blurry, and I felt very dizzy and unbalanced trying to walk. I had an important dentist appointment to go to, but I called and canceled because I didn't feel like I could safely drive there. Being 74 yrs. old, I didn't initially attribute these things to the gummy, and thought I might be beginning to have a heart attack or stroke and seriously considered either trying to drive to the ER or calling 911. I felt extremely frightened by what was happening to me, but since I've had no diagnosed heart or vascular problems, and by then reviewing that the only change in my morning routine was taking the gummie, I tried to remain calm and see if it would pass. I tried to sleep, but felt too awake and had too many anxious thoughts, so I put some soothing music on and crocheted. The feeling pretty much went away by 2pm...which was 6 hours after it started. I don't know if it's just me, my age, or someone mixed up that batch, but I never want to take another one no matter how much pain I have.",1,2024-03-04,miriam wolfe,US

They then after a week of receiving the products they are shipping more and I will be charge again. This is a good example of a scam.

I left the website immediately thinking something scammy is going on. Within 30 seconds I get an email from my bank wanting to know if the charge of $216 is 'ok' and do I want to proceed. For $216 bucks? Oh H#ll NO. My bank has never intervened with any of my purchases on-line! Hmmm, wonder why now? Bank rep said that because the Company has my card info, they are going to cancel my card and reissue a new one. I am so indebted to Chase for catching this!

The associate was very apologetic and polite. After 3 weeks of no shipped order, I emailed again to cancel the order. The associate refunded my order and told me it would still ship as an apology for the delay. That part I appreciated.

What I didn't appreciate was the continual promotional emails offering discounts while your order fulfillment was backed up for an entire month. I even got an email asking to rate this order before it was even shipped.

My original review was reflective of Purekana's delivery system and method of keeping customers updated. I only received an order number after several calls and emails. I never received any tracking emails, only emails from customer service telling me they could not find my order (the third customer service person did after searching) telling me to check my spam folder (which I had already checked). Purekana has a decent product. My only hesitation in reordering is to order and not receive any notifications citing my order number and updating me on whether it is shipped. I've changed my rating from one to three, based solely on them falling down in the order fulfillment system.


Did not receive my order. I have called and emailed numerous times. I was told there was no order, then told they found my order and it would be shipped. Never received a tracking email, so I don't know if I'll get it.",3,2023-10-16,S B,US
